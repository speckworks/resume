TECHNICAL PROJECTS
California Beach Finder ​ ​Github​ | ​Demo
California Beach Finder allows a user to enter a city name and locate beaches near them. The user can create a Login
and add beaches to their list of favorites. They can also save and update reviews of particular beaches. There is a data
visualization page for the app that allows a user to see the percentage of all beaches in a pie chart that represent the
following attributes: Stroller-Friendly, Restrooms, Camping, Fishing, Dog-Friendly and Bike-friendly.
● Used AJAX to fetch from 2 external APIs; Google React Maps and Google Geocode. Set beach locations based on
latitude and longitude of a user’s preferred city and parse them against a dataset of 1500 beaches to retrieve and
add markers for the nearest beaches within 11 miles of the city center according to google maps.
● Used REST Client to retrieve data on beaches from a Non-RESTful API at ​Coastal California Commission​ and seed
the Ruby on Rails Database.
● Served JSON from the Rails API, using ActiveRecord Serializers and framework.
● Used React for the Front End, implemented full C.R.U.D. for beach reviews and favorite beaches.
● Implemented JWT Auth to allow a user to login to create reviews and favorites.
Dinosaur Cards ​ ​Github​ | ​Demo
Dinosaur Cards generates customized “playing cards” for a user with a name of their choice, dinosaur illustration and a
background color. Cards can be persisted for future reference and sorted in reverse chronological order.
● Created a Rails API as the backend. Used ActiveRecord Serializers to render data for cards.
● Used React framework to create containers and components that build out the Front End.
● AJAX fetch for Background Colors and Dinosaur images serves data as JSON from the Ruby on Rails Backend.
● When a User inputs data via Controlled Form component, the app creates a Dinosaur Card through an AJAX
‘POST’-fetch that creates a “User Card” on the back end.
● Sourced compelling Dinosaur images from ​PaleoDB​, a scientific database assembled by hundreds of
paleontologists. Images are rendered on the Dinosaur cards displayed on the front end.
